# FRACE: Field-Regulated Acceleration from Cosmic Entanglement

Welcome to the official repository for the FRACE+ cosmology framework.

FRACE+ is a scalar-field-driven model designed to explain late-time cosmic acceleration through a decoherence phase transition at redshift \( z \approx 0.4 \). This repository contains the code, figures, and analysis used to identify a statistically significant suppression feature in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae dataset and to reconstruct a minimal scalar field \( \chi(z) = \gamma \log(1+z) \) capable of resolving the Hubble and \( S_8 \) tensions without altering early-universe physics.

## üîç Key Papers

- **Paper I:** *A Suppression Scar at \( z \approx 0.4 \): Evidence for a Decoherence Boundary in the FRACE+ Cosmology*  
  Focuses on the anomaly in Hubble residuals and presents the initial observational evidence.

- **Paper II:** *GRACE+: A Minimal Scalar Field Reconstruction for Resolving Late-Time Cosmological Tensions*  
  Introduces the theoretical mechanism and validates the scalar field dynamics through observational consistency checks.

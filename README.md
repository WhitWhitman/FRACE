# GRACE+: Field-Regulated Acceleration from Coarse-Grained Entropy

Welcome to the official repository for the **GRACE+ cosmology framework**.

**GRACE+** is a scalar-field-based cosmological model that explains late-time acceleration as the result of a **decoherence phase transition** occurring near redshift \( z \approx 0.4 \). This repository contains all supporting code, figures, and analysis used to identify a statistically significant suppression feature in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova dataset, and to reconstruct a minimal entropy field of the form:

\[
\chi(z) = \gamma \log(1 + z)
\]

capable of resolving both the **Hubble tension** and the **\( S_8 \)** discrepancy ‚Äî *without modifying early-universe physics*.

## üîç Key Papers

- **Paper I:** *GRACE+: A Minimal Scalar Field Reconstruction for Late-Time Cosmological Anomalies*  
  Develops the entropy field \(\chi(z)\) from observational residuals and introduces the GRACE+ model as a minimal, thermodynamic explanation for late-time acceleration.

- **Paper II:** *Fundamental Bounds on Entanglement-Gravity Coupling*  
  Establishes theoretical limits on entanglement-based gravity models and motivates the shift toward coarse-grained entropy fields as fundamental drivers of cosmic acceleration.
